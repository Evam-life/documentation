Production version - {{ version.current }}
=========================================

Here is the API reference for the current production version of the SDK.

This is the recommended version for any production deployment of your certified app.

All functions below are available in:

- the Evam platform (i.e. an actual Evam device)
- the development environment (web browser)

.. toctree::
   :glob:
   :maxdepth: 1

   gen/current/**

{% if version.alpha != version.current %}

Alpha version - {{ version.alpha }}
=====================================

Here is the API reference for the current alpha version of the SDK.

This is the recommended version if the production version does not yet integrate all
functions you need to develop your certified app.

The functions below are currently available in the development environment only.

.. toctree::
   :glob:
   :maxdepth: 1

   gen/alpha/**

{% endif %}

Roadmap
=======

The Evam SDK is evolving constantly to add more functions, data sharing and access to system functions.

This is how we plan on developing the SDK moving forward. If you have some input - such as a
feature request - please get in touch with us via the public or private issue tracker in the developer portal!

- Addition of new APIs for hardware access (CANBus, USB),
- Addition of new APIs for interacting with the Navigation App (add elements in the map, etc),
- Improvements to the Development environment.

Other versions
==============

Those versions of the SDK are here for reference only, it is recommended you use either the
Production or Alpha version instead.
