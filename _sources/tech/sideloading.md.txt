# Sideloading your application

```{admonition} Minimum version

Make sure you use the Evam SDK version 2.2.0 or above to use this feature.
```

```{attention} This is not a Development setup!

Sideloading should be done when your application has been developed and is fully working in the development environment.

Running an app in the Evam platform offers no debugging access or error messages, which is required when an app still undergoes development.

The development environment is implemented to replicate the Evam platform fully, running on real hardware does not require any adaptation.
```

Once developed, you may wish to run your application in an Evam device to showcase 
it running within the Evam platform.

To achieve this, you will need access to an Evam device. 
Get in touch with your Evam representative for this.

## Step 1 - Review your Evam manifest

Under `public/evam.json`, make sure to setup your Evam manifest with all required
fields. This is required for the platform to load the application correctly.

```{eval-rst}
See :ref:`using_the_sdk` for the Evam manifest format.
```

## Step 2 - Build a release version of your application

You should build your application:

```shell
npm run build
```
This will create a `build/` directory with the release application files.

## Step 3 - Connect your Evam device to your computer

Start by physically connecting your Evam device to your computer, 
your OS should notify you upon successful connection.

Then, make sure developer options and USB debugging are enabled in the Evam device. 
Refer to [the Android Developer documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options) to achieve this.
Make sure you also grant access to your computer by accepting the popup in the Evam device.

## Step 4 - Install your app by sideloading

You can now sideload your application:

```shell
npm exec evam-sideload
```

This command will install all required files to run your application within the 
Evam platform. Pay attention to its output to know if there is any issue.

A successful install should output something similar to this:

```
Installing to <SERIAL>...

Pushing /static/js/main.1431c619.js.LICENSE.txt
Pushing /static/js/main.1431c619.js.map
```

## Step 5 - Run the application

You may now start Vehicle Services on your Evam device.

Your application will show in the GUI shell with your logo and name.
Clicking its icon will open it.

The application will remain installed, so you do not need to install it again.

If you need to update the installed application, you should re-run this flow from step 3. 
Keep in mind you will need to restart Vehicle Services for the changes to apply.

At the moment, only one application can be sideloaded at a time, so sideloading a new application replaces the previous one.
